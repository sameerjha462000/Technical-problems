1. for setting terminus in sublime text in windows, open command palette and then type install package.
2. After this search for "terminus" package and then install it( This would take a sec or two).
3. After the "terminus" has been installed we need to make some changes so that you can directly open terminal in the sublime text.
4. Now go to Preferences >Package Settings > Terminus > Command Palette and paste this
   [
      {
        "caption": "Terminal (panel)",
        "command": "terminus_open",
        "args"   : {
           "cmd": "cmd.exe",
           "cwd": "${file_path:${folder}}",
           "title": "Command Prompt",
           "panel_name": "Terminus"
        }
     },
  ]
  
  5. After you have done this, go to Preferences >Package Settings > Terminus > Key Bindings
    [
	{
       		"keys": ["alt+1"],
       		"command": "terminus_open",
       		"args" : {
           		"cmd": "cmd.exe",
           		"cwd": "${file_path:${folder}}",
           		"panel_name": "Terminus"
       		}
    	}
  ]
  
 6. After this whenever you want to open the terminus just press "ALT+1".
