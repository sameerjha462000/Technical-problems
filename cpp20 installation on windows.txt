1. For installing c++20 on windows we first need to install a compiler -- On windows there are three such compilers -- Mingw, Msvc, Clang llvm
   -- we will be installing Mingw
2. Go to https://winlibs.com/
3. Select the latest 64bit zip version under the "release versions" and download the zip file.
4. After downloading the zip file, extract it and then you will get a "mingw64" folder.
5. Just copy paste this into your local C drive and now all you need to do is just set your path variable.
6. Now in environment variables just paste "C:\mingw64\bin" and you are good to go.


---------------------------------------------------------------------HOW TO RUN C++20 PROGRAMS------------------------------------------------------------------
1. make a new file on desktop named as hello.cpp and paste the following code in it.
    // C++ program to illustrate the
    // above concepts
    #include <bits/stdc++.h>
    #include <compare>
    using namespace std;

    // Driver Code
    int main()
    {
      int a = 91, b = 110;
      auto ans1 = (a <=> b);

      if (ans1 < 0) {
        cout << "a < b\n";
      }
      else if (ans1 == 0) {
        cout << "a == b\n";
      }
      else if (ans1 > 0) {
        cout << "a > b\n";
      }

      vector<int> v1{ 3, 6, 9 };
      vector<int> v2{ 3, 6, 9 };
      auto ans2 = (v1 <=> v2);

      if (ans2 < 0) {
        cout << "v1 < v2\n";
      }
      else if (ans2 == 0) {

        cout << "v1 == v2\n";
      }
      else if (ans2 > 0) {

        cout << "v1 > v2\n";
      }

      cout << endl;
    }
    
2. Now save this file as exp.cpp
3. To run this file open command line and then type "g++ -std=c++20 exp.cpp".
4. After the successfull compilation, an exe file would be created named as "a.exe".
5. Just type "a.exe" or simply "a" on command line to run this file.
6. You must see the following output
    a < b
    v1 == v2
